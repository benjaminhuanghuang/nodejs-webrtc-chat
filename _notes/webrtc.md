## PeerJs
  PeerJS is a JavaScript library that simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls.

## PeerServer
  PeerServer is the server-side component of PeerJS and allows two or more devices to connect together. 
  You can either implement it your own by using the PeerJS server library or use the PeerServer Cloud Service.
  
  - Use PeerServer Service
    
  - Running Your Own PeerServer
    If you’re planning to deploy to a remote server later on, it has to be via HTTPS. This is because browsers only allows access to a device’s camera and microphone if the connection is secure.
